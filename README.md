The Document Handling System is supposed to implement following features:

Spell Check and Word Suggestion: reading a text file, your system is required to pinpoint all the misspelled words in the file. A word is considered to be misspelled if it is not found in the dictionary. You will use the dictionary.txt file for this purpose. You need to think about possible data structures that you can use for a fast look up and which ones will support the implementation of all the requirements of the system. Once you determine that a word is misspelled, you are required to suggest up to 10 words as spelling suggestion for the misspelled word.

Auto-complete: Your system interface should provide a function that returns a set of words that all start with a given prefix. You are going to be using the same data as in feature 1 and this time try to achieve a fast retrieval of the words that have that prefix.


Document Retrieval: Given a set of files and key words, you system will print the names of the files that contain the given keywords in an efficient manner. Your system will also detect any possible misspellings and continue the retrieval process after automatically replacing the misspelled key word with the first one amongst the systemâ€™s suggestions from the feature one.
